        <p>The overreaching objective is to make as many matches, and develop as high a score as possible.</p>

        <hr/>
        <p>Matches must be made by swapping a jewel with a neighbor in any of the vertical or horizontal cardinal directions. Matches may not be made diagonally.</p>
        <p>A match is any continuous line of the same jewel consisting of a minimum of three jewels. You will be rewarded with points depending on how large your match is.</p>
        <p>Matches may intersect horizontally and vertically.</p>

        <hr/>

        <p>The game is over when no more matches can be made.</p>
